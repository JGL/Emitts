This project is part of the [Making Movement Irresistable project](http://makingmovementirresistible.org) - "Making Movement Irresistible (MMI) is a research project funded by Arts Council of Wales, National Lottery Health & Wellbeing award. The overarching aim is to develop an innovative suite of digital, online and wearable accessories that encourage improvisational movement interactions with older adults in a variety of residential settings."

This repository currently contains five different Xcode projects:

1. 01_viaKodecoExampleCode
2. 02_viaAppleExampleCode
3. 03_visualisingGestures
4. 04_viaSofiaDinizFreshStart
5. 05_manualActionSelection

01_viaKodecoExampleCode is based on the following code:

<https://github.com/raywenderlich/video-vii-materials/tree/versions/1.0>

Which was associated with the following article: [Detect Hand & Body Poses with Vision in iOS](https://www.kodeco.com/21129427-detect-hand-body-poses-with-vision-in-ios) from [Kodeco.com](https://www.kodeco.com) previously known as [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com).

The original raywenderlich.com source code was released on 2021/06/01 and is licensed as in the  raywenderlichlicense in the 01_viaKodecoExampleCode folder.

02_viaAppleExampleCode is based on the code released with the [WWDC 2021 session "Classify hand poses and actions with Create ML"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10039/).

03_visualisingGestures was inspired by the Paul Hudson video: [SwiftUI Special Effects – TimelineView, Canvas, particles, and… AirPods?!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raR-hDgzoFg).

04_viaSofiaDinizFreshStart was based around the [BabyChat released by Sofia Diniz](https://github.com/sofiadinizms/WWDC23).

05_manualActionSelection is a combination of all of the above, made before the support of Greg Chiste at Apple Developer Technical Support, who bug fixed the Hand Action recognition.
